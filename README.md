# Light Deep Thinking Model (WIP)

Welcome to the Light Deep Thinking Model repository! This project aims to develop a **lighter deep thinking model** inspired by the OpenAI O1 model. Our goal is to demystify the latest advancements in artificial intelligence and provide a clearer understanding of how these algorithms function.

In this repository, you'll find resources and code designed to help you explore the intricacies of Deep Thinking Models. We will look into the architecture, functionality, and applications, making the material accessible to both beginners and seasoned practitioners.

## Overview

The Light Deep Thinking Model is an efficient neural architecture that enables recursive and hierarchical reasoning while minimizing computational complexity. By incorporating sparse attention mechanisms, hybrid models (RNNs and transformers), and external memory networks, this model effectively handles complex reasoning tasks.

Additionally, it integrates **reinforcement learning (RL)** frameworks, enabling the development of decision-making systems that can engage in strategic and recursive thinking, allowing the model to "think" about its outputs.

## Key Features
- **Lightweight Architecture**: Efficiently designed to retain core functionalities without excessive computational costs.
- **Recursive Reasoning**: Implements recursive structures, such as Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs), for step-by-step task processing.
- **Efficient Attention**: Utilizes sparse attention mechanisms to reduce the computation cost associated with global attention models.
- **Hybrid Models**: Combines transformers and RNNs for powerful yet lightweight reasoning capabilities.
- **Memory-Augmented Networks**: Incorporates memory networks to store intermediate reasoning steps, enabling the model to recall and refine its outputs.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL) Integration**: Links the deep thinking model with RL methods to explore decision-making and planning tasks.
