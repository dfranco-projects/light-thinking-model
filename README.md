# Lighter Deep Thinking Model

## Overview
This project aims to develop a **lighter deep thinking model** inspired by the O1 model. The goal is to build an efficient neural architecture that enables recursive and hierarchical reasoning while minimizing computational complexity. By incorporating sparse attention mechanisms, hybrid models (RNNs and transformers), and external memory networks, this model will handle complex reasoning tasks more efficiently.

The project also explores how such models can be integrated into **reinforcement learning (RL)** frameworks to develop decision-making systems capable of strategic and recursive thinking.

## Key Features
- **Recursive Reasoning**: Implementing recursive structures, such as Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs), for step-by-step processing of tasks.
- **Efficient Attention**: Use of sparse attention mechanisms to reduce the computation cost of global attention models.
- **Hybrid Models**: A combination of transformers and RNNs for lightweight but powerful reasoning.
- **Memory-Augmented Networks**: Adding memory networks to store intermediate reasoning steps and allow the model to recall and refine its outputs.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL) Integration**: Linking the deep thinking model with RL methods to explore decision-making and planning tasks.
